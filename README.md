### Greetings

By day I spend most of my time building Streamer tech for Streamers.

You may have seen my work on [CohhCarnage](https://twitch.tv/cohhcarnage), [itmeJP](https://twitch.tv/itmejp) or [Sacriel](https://twitch.tv/sacriel).

I build everything from Chatbots, to Twitch Extensions, websites and everything in between.

I spend a lot of time helping people on the Twitch Dev [Forum](https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/) or [Discord](https://link.twitch.tv/devchat) which has led me to build the [Supporting Examples Repository](https://github.com/barrycarlyon/twitch_misc)

I run a not very often updated [Blog on my Website](http://barrycarlyon.co.uk)

I am a [Twitch (Dev) Ambassador](https://www.twitch.tv/team/ambassadors)
